# MapAble

> MapAble helps individuals improve accessibility for the disability community. Report non-accessibility areas, join the conversation and make a difference.

## What it does üßê

MapAble is a web application that helps the disability community in Singapore by **enabling users to report and map** areas in their neighbourhood that are **not accessibility-friendly**. This helps to create a **visual representation** of the challenges faced by the community and **sparks conversation** around potential solutions.

## Try it out!

MapAble was built for NUS GDSC [Hack for Good 2023](https://dsc.comp.nus.edu.sg/hack4good).

## How we built it üõ†Ô∏è

We built MapAble using the following tech stack: React, TypeScript, Firebase, Chakra UI, and the Google Maps API. This stack was chosen for its scalability, robustness, and ease of use. This allowed us to create an intuitive and interactive platform for users to easily report issues and engage with each other.

## Challenges we ran into üí™

Building a platform that accurately reflects the needs of the disability community was a challenge we were excited to tackle. We wanted to ensure that the reporting process was straightforward and user-friendly, while also incorporating features that provided value to the community such as categorizing each report by type of disability and using the user's current location to drop a pin on the map.

During the development of MapAble, we faced a number of challenges, including integrating Google Maps API with the app, ensuring data security and privacy, and ensuring the app was accessible for users with disabilities. However, through perseverance and collaboration, we were able to overcome these obstacles and deliver a high-quality product.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of üéâ

As developers, we are always looking for opportunities to put our skills to good use and make a positive contribution to society. We are proud that we were able to take these steps towards spreading awareness and supporting the disabled community of Singapore through this project.

## What we learned üí°

During the development process, we gained valuable insights into the difficulties faced by individuals with disabilities and the importance of creating inclusive and accessible environments. This project has reminded us of the power of technology in making a positive impact on society. We also learned the importance of understanding the needs of users with disabilities and how best to serve their needs through technology.

## What's next for MapAble üöÄ

In the future, we aim to further improve the platform by incorporating more features such as **searching for locations** via name, an **authentication system with Singpass** to discourage spam, and lazy loading to **ensure scalability** of the platform as more reports are made.

Integrating with **OneService**, a Singaporean mobile app for reporting municipal issues to local town councils, is an exciting key next step for MapAble. By partnering with the **government and town councils**, we aim to ensure that the accessibility issues reported on our platform receive **prompt and effective solutions**. This will allow us to have a greater impact on the disabled community in Singapore and make a **tangible difference** in their lives.
